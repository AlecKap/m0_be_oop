# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - It felt great to utilize all the things we have learned. And I feel like my productive struggles are becoming more and more productive!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I have been shocked at how well i have been managing my time, honestly. I think the google calander has really helped!

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    - I think as long as i follow my plan and use my support system i will be successful.
